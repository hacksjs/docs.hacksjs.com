= Build configuration for the Hacks.js User Documentation web site

This repository encapsulates the code and configuration to compile and publish the https://docs.hacksjs.com/[Hacks.js User Documentation] web site.

The web site is built using https://antora.org/[Antora], a specialist static site generator for documentation sites, while builds web pages from AsciiDoc source files.

Antora uses a "playbook" configuration file — `antora-playbook.yml` — to control what content is included in a web site build, what the site looks like, and where it is published. In keeping with https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/playbook/[Antora's best practices], this repository is strictly for Antora playbook configuration.

There is no content in this repository. Instead, the content for the Hacks.js web site is pulled from the source repositories for individual `@hacksjs/*` packages, to keep the documentation close to the code.
